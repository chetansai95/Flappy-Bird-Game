Creating a Flappy Bird web application using HTML involves building a simplified version of the classic game. The process includes setting up an HTML structure with a canvas element for rendering. CSS is used to style the canvas and other elements. JavaScript is employed to implement game logic, define components, and capture user input. Drawing functions animate the game, while collision detection ensures challenge. Players score by passing pipes successfully. A game over screen displays the final score, and testing ensures smooth functionality on various devices and browsers. By following these steps, a basic Flappy Bird web application can be created for online enjoyment.
